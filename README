We hereby solemnly present the OpenSanAndreasMap (OSAM) project.

The goal of OSAM is, to provide the GTA:SA community with a free available,
customizable map of San Andreas.

The tools are based on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project. The map is created with JOSM,
using the conventions of OSM until we've got our own conventions for mapping GTA.
